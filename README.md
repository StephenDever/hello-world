# hello-world

StephenDever stands for Stephen Developer, in case you didn't already guess that. I'm just starting out as a developer, but I aspire to work on the most cuttng edge apps and web content. I enjoy problem solving, I just need to learn how to use the tools and languages that can put me in a position to use my problem solving abilities.
